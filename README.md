# Steps for spoofing
 * Download the sites content
   * I used this [plugin for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozilla-archive-format/?src=search)
 * Save as maff file (Ctrl-s)
 * Open the maff file as a zip
 * Find the index.html and resource folder

Open the index.html file and see "real" site.
